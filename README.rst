CurryProxy
==========
A fast and performant proxy and aggregator for querying multiple instances of an API spread across globally distributed data centers.

Capabilities
------------
- CurryProxy can handle multiple `routes <https://github.com/rackerlabs/curryproxy/wiki/Routes>`_ for use against different revisions of an API or for use against completely unrelated APIs. See `etc/routes.sample.json <https://github.com/rackerlabs/curryproxy/blob/master/etc/routes.sample.json>`_ for an example configuration.

- Simple request forwarding (useful for preserving backwards compatability with pre-CurryProxy versions of an API hosted in a single datacenter)

  - Example: ``GET https://api.example.com/v1.0/foo/bar`` forwarded to ``GET https://1.api.example.com/v1.0/foo/bar``

- Advanced request forwarding to multiple endpoints

  - Example: ``GET https://api.example.com/1,2/v1.0/foo/bar`` forwarded to the following:
  
    - ``GET https://1.api.example.com/v1.0/foo/bar``
        
    - ``GET https://2.api.example.com/v1.0/foo/bar``
        
  - Requests are made in parallel
    
  - JSON responses received from multiple endpoints are `aggregated <https://github.com/rackerlabs/curryproxy/wiki/Multiple-Endpoints-Aggregation>`_ and returned to the client
    
    - Example: ``{"foo": 1}`` received from 1 and ``{"bar": 2}`` received from 2 are aggregated to ``[{"foo": 1}, {"bar": 2}]`` and returned to the client
        
  - Rich, meaningful `errors <https://github.com/rackerlabs/curryproxy/wiki/Multiple-Endpoints-Aggregation#error-handling>`_ logged *and* returned to the client when a proxied request fails

Installation
------------


``pip install curryproxy`` will do what you expect.

There are a couple of extra options:

- ``pip install curryproxy[tests]``. This will install any packages
  required to run the tests.

- ``pip install curryproxy[frozen]``. This will install curryproxy with
  explicitly pinned dependencies, as generated by ``pip freeze``. This
  is intended as a convenience for those who want the package to provide
  a reproducible environment. The versions used will be the latest
  working ones at the time the given Curry version was released.

You will need to provide `configuration files`_ before starting Curry.

Limitations
-----------
- Merging responses from multiple endpoints together occurs only under certain conditions outlined on the `Multiple Endpoints Aggregation <https://github.com/rackerlabs/curryproxy/wiki/Multiple-Endpoints-Aggregation>`_ wiki page.

Testing
-------

Tests are set up to run with ``tox``.

The default ``tox`` setup creates environments for each known-usable
version of each of our dependencies, and runs the tests in each of them.
That amounts to around a dozen environments at the moment, so you'll
probably want to run them in parallel with ``tox -p auto``.

If you don't want to be that thorough (perhaps you're smoke testing a
work in progress), you can run against only the most recent supported
versions of dependencies with ``tox -e py27``.

You can test against specific dependency versions like this:

::

  tox -e py27-requests2.{2,3,4,5,6,7} -p auto
  tox -e py27-webob1.{2,3,4,5} -p auto
  tox -e py27-grequests0.{2,3} -p auto
  tox -e py27-requests.latest

``tox -e lint`` is also available, and will run various linting checks.

Roadmap
-------
- OData support for server-side ordering and paging
- Response caching for a specified time
